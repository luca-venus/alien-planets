# Alien Planet information
This is the Alien planet project. This project displays important information about alien planets in a table. This project was created using create-react-app. 

### To start project 
Run the following:
* yarn 
* yarn start
* Opens window in browser to view project automatically, on `http://localhost:3000/`

### Tools used

I decided to use React and Material UI. Material ui allows rapid development for visual components while React has hooks to make data fetching and state management very straightforward. Additionally, I used lodash to sort the response from the API. 

### Missing pieces 

If allowed more time I would have written tests and added prettier and linters.

### Possible Project expansion

* Result Pagination
* Responsive sorting on the table 
* Page dedicated to planet that is linked to from the table
